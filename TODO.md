## UI

- Make pieces draggable
- Organize sidebar by making buttons on the same row and using icons (maybe?)
- Add ability to flip the board view
- (maybe) add ability to change the color of the board. Maybe have different
  themes?
- Make it so clicking on the most recent move allows you to make a move - IN PROGRESS
- Allow highlighting of square when right clicked
- Make engine battle have a modal that shows progress on allows termination (maybe?)

## Engine
- Improve evaluation function with things such as king safety
- Add adaptive piece square tables as the game progresses
- Fix issue with en passant not being seen as a legal move when the king is in check.
- Add 50 move rule to engine sim

## General
- Optimize functions further
