## UI

- Make pieces draggable
- Organize sidebar by making buttons on the same row and using icons (maybe?)
- Add ability to flip the board view
- (maybe) add ability to change the color of the board. Maybe have different
  themes?

## Engine

- Improve evaluation function using tables that show where pieces "should" go
- Implement magic bitboards
- Implement move storing / transposition table
- Fix hash function to include castling rights - IN PROGRESS
- Make it so engines play a predetermined opening so they don't play the same
  game every time against each other.

## General

- Find a way to test my fucntions robustly
- Optimize functions further
